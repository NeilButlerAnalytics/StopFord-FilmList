The idea of this test is to add a column to the table that is displayed in the StopfordTechTest application under the ‘Film List’ heading.

Requirements:
The main requirement of this application is to add a new column, named "Rating", to the film table.
This will require you to add to read in the values from the CSV and present to the interface.
If you have time to complete that then the search feature on the page is currently broken, so you can attempt to fix that.
As well as the above two there are a couple of issues currently in the application. 
Currently the taglines are coming through to the interface as the film name.
Also the film list is very slow to load.
